## The Brief

At School of Code, our team was challenged to build a React application and deliver a functional MVP within just 2 days.


<h2>Documentation</h2>

<h3><u>MVP</u></h3>

- A random image to display with a set of 3 multiple choice buttons.
- The image requires a matching correct answer, and two fake answers pulled from the remaining owl name pool.
- A Small sample data size (5 owls).
- Passable CSS.

<h3><u>Update 1</u></h3>

- A simple score tracker.
- An edited Owl SFX, that triggers on every correct answer.

## Future Milestones

<h3><u>MS2</u></h3>

- More owls.
- An initial starting state (aka to hide the Q & A).
- More interesting CSS and/or transition animations.

<h3><u>MS3</u></h3>

- Make the app compatible for phone screens.
- Add background music, and/or additional ambience.
